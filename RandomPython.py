#This is late night coding for me to let loose and just code what I want without it being tied to anything
#Although some code might make its way into future or even current projects, but for the most part
#This is for me having fun and wanting to code!
#ALSO - This is me trying to remember how to do things!

#We are going to put all global or instance vars here
tempVar = 0

#We are going to define all functions here
def function1():
    print("We are in function 1!")

def main():
    print("This is going to be epic!")
    name = input("Please enter your name ")
    print(name)
    function1()




#This is where we call the functions - main() will always be at bottom
main()
