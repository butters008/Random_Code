# Random_Code

The purpose of this repo has changed somewhat. This repo will serve as two purposes:

1. This repo will be used for any night time random programming I want to do, also it is not tied to any project I am currently working.
2. A place where I can practice coding tech stacks that I need for projects (VERY small project and idea) and practice new languages for my work
3. A reference I can look to when I am trying to tutor

## RULES FOR THE REPO

Anyone can look and fork from this repo if they desire, but no-one is allowed to submit any code into this repo as this is a place for me to
practice coding late a night. I do not want to troubleshoot issues on the repo from a bad commit.

### JavaScript

Right now, no backend JS is set up.

### Python

Just trying to keep up what I know with that language
