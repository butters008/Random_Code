# Random_Code
 The Random Code repo is going to be a long term repo that I will be working on.  Within this repo, I will be working on code in languages that I normally do not work OR languages that I do know and want know more or practive in.  These programs are meant to be small scale and independent from each other, so that I can either add to them or run them independently (So, if there is two java projects, they will not interfere with each other and ect.). 

 ## RULES FOR THE REPO
 This repo is meant for learning, so you can look and pull all you want.  Just, don't straight up copy and paste without some type of acknowledgment as to where you got the code from.
